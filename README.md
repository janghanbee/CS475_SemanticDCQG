## Abstract

>This paper proposes several methods that can develop the performance of the existing Difficulty Controllable Question Generation (DCQG) system. In the previous DCQG system, there was a limitation in generating only syntactically complex or simple questions by defining difficulty by simply the number of inference steps. We introduce question paraphras- ing and context simplification to make the difference in the semantic difficulty of questions more noticeable. In our work, we propose a new semantic difficulty controllable question generation model that can control semantic question difficulty rather than syntactical difficulty.
